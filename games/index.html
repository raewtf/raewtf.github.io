			<h3>Featured Projects</h3>
			<h1>Traffic Jam</h1>
			<h2>Coming to Catalog 05.20.2025</h2>
			<img src="traffic_preview.gif" />
			<p>Traffic Jam is a fun endless rhythm game that exclusively uses the Playdate's crank. Watch out for four car types with distinct cue patterns, keep the beat (as well as you can, at least) while the tempo gets ever faster, and try to avoid a nasty collision! Features classic non-stop rhythm-action fun, in-depth statistics, and an unlockable Hardcore Mode to really test your skills.</p>

			<h1>Bona Fido</h1>
			<img src="bona_preview.gif" />
			<p>Bona Fido is a fast-paced, single-screen platformer, inspired by classic arcade games but with a spooOOooky twist. Try for a new high score again and again as you narrowly dodge enemies, dig up treasures that could either help you eke out a record or spell your utter demise, and bark your way to becoming top dog of the afterlife! Don't worry, it only goes on forever.</p>

			<h1>RowBot Rally</h1>
			<img src="rowbot_preview.gif" />
			<p>So, you wanna enter the big annual boat-racing competition! It's quite an important event, you know. Alas, evil “RowBots” have torn the whole tourney from the hands of human — <i>(err, animal?)</i> — racers, and the competition’s only getting worse. By tandem-rowing with a defective junkyard RowBot of your own, it’s your goal to defeat these baddies…but soon you may realize, that these waters go deeper than you thought.</p>

			<h1>HEXA</h1>
			<img src="hexa_preview.gif" />
			<p><i>Board the helm of Starship HEXA, and conquer the universe the only way you know how: shapes.</i><br><br>Conquer the HEXAPLEX, wrangle those Power-ups, and maybe even become ruler of the universe along the way in <i>HEXA</i>, a triangle-matching puzzle game with gameplay that's dead-simple, but tons of fun. With an action-packed Arcade Mode, a low-stakes Chill Mode, and a Daily Run with dynamic leaderboards.</p>

			<h1>First in... Line?</h1>
			<img src="line_preview.gif" />
			<p><i>"It's opening night, and our lead star dropped out! Can you memorize these lines REALLY quickly?"</i><br><br>Memorize your lines, take to the stage and try not to flub it too hard as you fill in for the lead role in <i>First in... Line?</i>, a fun endless game made just for Playdate! The original version was completed over the course of just a day and a half, during PlayJam 5.</p>
