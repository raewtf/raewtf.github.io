## Synopsis

> *Guide the traffic to the beat, don't get swept up off your feet.*

Nebulous construction work's a tough job, and somebody has to manage the traffic going in and out. Luckily, you happened to be around when they were scrambling in a blind panic to find somebody who could do it! Can you master the new rhythm-based method of guiding these overzealous cars?

Traffic Jam is a fun endless rhythm game that exclusively uses the Playdate's crank. Watch out for four car types with distinct cue patterns, keep the beat (as well as you can, at least) while the tempo gets ever faster, and try to avoid a nasty collision! Features classic non-stop rhythm-action fun, in-depth statistics, and an unlockable Hardcore Mode to really test your skills.

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The Crank is the main control method for this game. The D-pad and A and B buttons are used to navigate menus.

Audio is quite important to gameplay â€” while the game can be played silently by a more experienced player, having an active audio output is recommended.

## Gameplay

During the game, your crank is separated into two "fields" â€” left, and right. Cranking across the 0Âº or 180Âº boundaries will swap between them.

At certain points, cars will zoom in from either side of the screen. Depending on the car, a different warning cue will be provided to let you get ready to wave them through in the correct direction.

Scoring happens when the car passes you â€” if your sign is pointing in the correct direction, you'll gain a point. Otherwise, you won't gain a point, and will lose a life.

# Modes

## Normal Mode

Normal Mode is the basic gameplay mode in *Traffic Jam*.

In this mode, you have three lives. A life is lost whenever you don't wave a car through in the correct direction â€” indicated by a screen-shake and a skidding noise.

This mode starts out at approximately 120 BPM. When you reach Level 5, every new round will increase the BPM by +5.

## Hardcore Mode

> ðŸ’¡ *This Mode is only unlocked after scoring 50 or greater in Normal Mode.*

In Hardcore Mode, the default BPM is upped to 150, and you also have only one life â€” miss any amount of times, and it's game over.
