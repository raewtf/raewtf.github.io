## Synopsis

> *Board the helm of Starship HEXA, and conquer the universe the only way you know how: shapes.*

YYou're the commander of Starship HEXA, the head of an evil space fleet dead set on taking over the universe. You're well on your way to assuming control of everything that is and shall be; however, your attack methods are a bit unorthodox... We can't dwell on it for too long, though, so get out there and match those hexagons!

HEXA is a unique match-six puzzle game with gameplay that's dead-simple, but tons of fun. Try for a high score in the action-packed Arcade Mode, kick back in the low-stakes Chill Mode, or take on the seeded Daily Run with a dynamic leaderboard! With addictive puzzle gameplay, on-line leaderboards, and a banger soundtrack; see if you can't conquer the HEXAPLEX, wrangle those Power-ups, and maybe even become ruler of the universe along the way. Give it a try... it's HEXA-good!

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The D-pad and A and B buttons are required to play this game. These buttons are used to navigate menus, and are mandatory in main gameplay.

You can also optionally use the Crank to perform the turning action usually done by the A and B buttons. This can be toggled in the Options menu, or in-game via the Slide menu. (The Crank can also be used to navigate menus.)

## Playing the game

When you start a new game, you'll be faced with the HEXAPLEX ‚Äî a grid of 19 triangles (black, gray, or white), all interlaced with one another. Your goal is simple: create HEXAs!

Use the D-pad to navigate your Cursor along the HEXAPLEX, and the A and B buttons (or the Crank) to rotate the currently-selected hexagon clockwise or counter-clockwise ‚Äî this is called a Swap.

A full hexagon of similarly-colored triangles is called a HEXA. These are the main way to earn points ‚Äî create a HEXA match, and BOOM!! You gain points, and the triangles involved are replaced with all new colors.

When the game ends, you'll get a read-out of how many Swap you've made, and how many HEXAs you've matched.

As far as basic gameplay is concerned...that's all you need to know! But, depending on the mode you're playing, there are a few more things you need to know...

# Modes

## Arcade Mode

Arcade Mode is the basic gameplay mode in *HEXA*.

In this mode, you start out with 45 seconds on the clock. As you match HEXAs, you'll earn points, as well as more time on the timer! Your goal is to match as many HEXAs, and thus, earn as many points, as you can before time runs out.

There's another element to this mode to keep you on your toes: randomly-generated Power-ups that do various things when matched.

- Bombs ‚Äî If matched into a HEXA, the whole board gets "blown up" and replaced with a new, randomized set of triangles.
- 2x Tiles ‚Äî When matched into a HEXA, you'll earn double points for that match!
- Wild Tiles ‚Äî These tiles can be used in place of any other color when creating a HEXA. There's no penalty or reward.

You can also score HEXA Combos, mostly by luck ‚Äî if you match a HEXA, and the resulting grid contains another HEXA, BOOM!! You'll get double points for that match! This stacks exponentially up until you reach a board state without an immediate HEXA.

An unmodified HEXA is worth 100 points, but if you make good use of 2x Tiles and get lucky with Combos, you'll be well on your way to becoming master of the universe!

HEXAs will also earn you more time: +5 seconds for an unmodified match, and +7.5 seconds for a match with a 2x Tile inside, up to a maximum of 60 seconds.

The game will end when the timer reaches zero. If you wanna end it early, open the Slide menu and just select "end game". The game will end from the current point, and any high scores will be saved.

## Chill Mode

Chill Mode is a more relaxed experience, meant for casual play.

In this mode, there's no score-keeping, Power-ups, or timers. The goal is just to chill out, and have a good time creating HEXA matches at your own pace!

To end the game, open the Slide menu and select "i'm done!" to wrap up.

## Daily Run

Daily Run plays a lot like Arcade Mode, but with one big catch: you only get one shot per day!

In this mode, the board is *seeded* ‚Äî every day, you play with the same starting layout as everyone else. From here, it plays just like Arcade Mode!

When you end the game, you won't be able to play again until tomorrow. The Daily Run refreshes automatically at 00:00 midnight GMT, after which you'll be able to play another game with a new layout.

> üí° *There's also a handy timer on the Title screen to let you know when the next run will appear!*

# On-line Capability

## About on-line play

This game connects to Playdate's on-line leaderboard API, to enable sending and receiving of high scores among players across the globe. To use on-line functionality in this game, make sure your Playdate has an active Wireless connection.

## Submitting your scores

To submit a new score to a global leaderboard, simply complete a game. When you reach the end results screen, your score will be submitted to the proper leaderboard automatically.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Be careful ‚Äî if you close out of the game without properly ending your run, your score won't be saved or submitted!*

## Viewing global scores

You can view global scores using two primary methods:

1. Visit the *HEXA* game page in your Web browser, at [play.date/games/hexa](https://play.date/games/hexa/). From here, you can view all available scores in the Scoreboards section. You can see top 10 scores in every available board.

2. Enter the 'High Scores' menu within the game, accessible from the Title screen. When in this screen, you can use the A button to toggle between the Arcade Mode and Daily Run leaderboards. From here, you can see the top 9 scores for the currently-highlighted board, as well as your own score and ranking (if available).

The Daily Run leaderboard refreshes automatically at 00:00 midnight GMT, clearing all scores from the past day. When viewing scores in-game, there's also a handy timer to tell you when the boards will be cleared.

# Additional Notes

This game started life on the 4th of July, 2024. It came together pretty much over the weekend ‚Äî initially being sent to the Catalog on July 7th, and approved on the 10th. That means over the span of just a week, the game went from "thought in my head" to "approved for Catalog"! By all accounts, this is a freak accident.
