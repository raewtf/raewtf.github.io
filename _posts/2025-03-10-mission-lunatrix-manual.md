## Synopsis

> One small ollie for man, one giant kickflip for mankind.

*"Captain's log: stardate...something-or-other. It's been about 3 days since the lander made a rather high-speed landing into the Moon's surface. My oxygen supplies are running low, my only possession that survived the crash is my trusty skateboard, and I need to find a way back home. ...Now, this might sound crazy—"* [END TRANSMISSION]

When you find yourself trapped on the surface of an unfamiliar terrain, there's only one thing that can bring you back to terra firma...*EPIC SKATE TRICKS*. Can you jump, grind and shred your way to escape velocity before time runs out? Mission LunaTrix is a radical sports-arcade game featuring innovative 3D terrain, plenty of strategy, and a bumpin' original soundtrack.

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The d-pad and crank are required to play this game. The D-pad and A and B buttons are used to navigate menus.

## Gameplay

Navigate the moon's surface, in search of opportunities to perform epic skate tricks. There are three types of things you may encounter in your venture:

- Craters — These are very good! Hit them to ramp off and leap into a moon jump.
- O2 Canisters — These are good! They replenish some of your oxygen when you hit them.
- Rovers — These are bad! If you hit one, you'll get briefly stunned.

It's important to keep an eye on your oxygen levels — if they reach zero, you'll be rather...stranded. You can replenish your oxygen by picking up O2 canisters, or by completing the current level — your gauge will re-fill on every successful escape.

## Scoring

Ramping off of craters and performing tricks is key to your escape! When you're sent into the air, use the crank in tandem with the d-pad to pull off different moves. Advanced ones can score big points!

When you reach a high enough score threshold, you'll start flashing. This means you've got enough radical power charged up to escape the gravitational pull! Hit another crater, and you'll be launched out to the next moon.

When you land from a jump, your combo meter will increase. Hit another jump to rack up the multiplier and score MASSIVE points! If you skate around for long enough without hitting another crater, your meter will reset back to x1.
