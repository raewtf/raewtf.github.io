## Synopsis

> One small ollie for man, one giant kickflip for mankind.

*"Captain's log: stardate...something-or-other. It's been about 3 days since the lander made a rather high-speed landing into the Moon's surface. My oxygen supplies are running low, my only possession that survived the crash is my trusty skateboard, and I need to find a way back home. ...Now, this might sound crazy—"* [END TRANSMISSION]

When you find yourself trapped on the surface of an unfamiliar terrain, there's only one thing that can bring you back to terra firma...*EPIC SKATE TRICKS*. Can you jump, grind and shred your way to escape velocity before time runs out? Mission LunaTrix is a radical sports-arcade game featuring innovative 3D terrain, plenty of strategy, and a bumpin' original soundtrack.

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The d-pad and crank are required to play this game. The D-pad and A and B buttons are used to navigate menus.

## Gameplay

Navigate the moon's surface, in search of opportunities to perform epic skate tricks. There are five types of objects you may encounter in your lunar venture:

- Craters — These are good! Hit 'em and launch into a jump.
- O2 Canisters — These are good! They replenish oxygen.
- UFOs — These are rad! Hit 'em and score bonus points.
- Flags — Fun collectible! I wonder who's been here?
- Rovers — These are bad! Hit one, and you get stunned.

Ramp off craters, rack up points, and make your way back home! Or at least, to another moon...

It's important to keep an eye on your oxygen levels. If they reach zero, you'll be rather...stranded. You can replenish oxygen by picking up O2 Canisters, or by escaping the current moon. Your O2 gauge will re-fill on every successful escape.

## Scoring

Ramping off of craters and performing tricks is key to your escape! When you're sent into the air, use the crank in tandem with the d-pad to pull off different moves. Advanced ones can score big points!

When you reach a high enough score threshold, you'll start flashing. This means you've got enough radical power charged up to escape the gravitational pull! Hit another crater, and you'll be launched to the next moon.

### Combos

When you successfully land from a jump, your combo meter will increase. Hit more jumps to rack up the multiplier and score MASSIVE points! There's no limit, so go wild! Your final score is displayed at the end.

If you skate around for long enough without hitting another crater, run into a rover, or get too overzealous with your tricks, your meter will reset back to x1.
