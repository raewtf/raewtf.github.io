# HEXA

## Synopsis

> *Board the helm of Starship HEXA, and conquer the universe the only way you know how: shapes.*

You're the commander of Starship HEXA, the head of an evil space fleet dead set on taking over the universe. You're well on your way to assuming control of everything that is and shall be; however, your attack methods are a bit unorthodox... We can't dwell on it for too long, though, so get out there and match those hexagons!

HEXA is a triangle-matching puzzle game with gameplay that's dead-simple, but tons of fun. Try for a high score in the action-packed Arcade Mode, with power-ups and a looming timer; or kick back in the low-stakes Zen Mode and hone your skills! With on-line leaderboards, addictive puzzle gameplay, and a banger soundtrack; see if you can't conquer the HEXAPLEX, wrangle those Power-ups, and maybe even become ruler of the universe along the way! Give it a try... it's HEXA-good!

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The D-pad and A and B buttons are required to play this game. These buttons are used to navigate menus, and are mandatory in main gameplay.

You can also optionally use the Crank to perform the turning action usually done by the A and B buttons. This can be toggled in the Options menu, or in-game via the Slide menu. (The Crank can also be used to navigate menus.)

## Playing the game

When you start a new game, you'll be faced with the HEXAPLEX — a grid of 19 triangles (black, gray, or white), all interlaced with one another. Your goal is simple: create HEXAs!

Use the D-pad to navigate your Cursor along the HEXAPLEX, and the A and B buttons (or the Crank) to rotate the currently-selected hexagon clockwise or counter-clockwise — this is called a Swap.

A full hexagon of similarly-colored triangles is called a HEXA. These are the main way to earn points — create a HEXA match, and BOOM!! You gain points, and the triangles involved are replaced with all new colors.

When the game ends, you'll get a read-out of how many Swap you've made, and how many HEXAs you've matched.

As far as basic gameplay is concerned...that's all you need to know! But, depending on the mode you're playing, there are a few more things you need to know...

# Modes

## Arcade Mode

Arcade Mode is the basic gameplay mode in *HEXA*.

In this mode, you start out with 45 seconds on the clock. As you match HEXAs, you'll earn points, as well as more time on the timer! Your goal is to match as many HEXAs, and thus, earn as many points, as you can before time runs out.

There's another element to this mode to keep you on your toes: randomly-generated Power-ups that do various things when matched.

- Bombs — If matched into a HEXA, the whole board gets "blown up" and replaced with a new, randomized set of triangles.
- 2x Tiles — When matched into a HEXA, you'll earn double points for that match!
- Wild Tiles — These tiles can be used in place of any other color when creating a HEXA. There's no penalty or reward.

You can also score HEXA Combos, mostly by luck — if you match a HEXA, and the resulting grid contains another HEXA, BOOM!! You'll get double points for that match! This stacks exponentially up until you reach a board state without an immediate HEXA.

An unmodified HEXA is worth 100 points, but if you make good use of 2x Tiles and get lucky with Combos, you'll be well on your way to becoming master of the universe!

HEXAs will also earn you more time: +5 seconds for an unmodified match, and +7.5 seconds for a match with a 2x Tile inside, up to a maximum of 60 seconds.

The game will end when the timer reaches zero. If you wanna end it early, open the Slide menu and just select "end game". The game will end from the current point, and any high scores will be saved.

## Zen Mode

Zen Mode is a more chill experience, meant for casual play.

In this mode, there's no score-keeping, Power-ups, or timers. The goal is just to chill out, and have a good time creating HEXA matches at your own pace!

To end the game, open the Slide menu and select "i'm done!" to wrap up.
