## Synopsis

> *Turns out the afterlife's not as bad as they say! Well, except for all the terrifying monsters, at least.*

"Hey. Name's Fido. I'm a dog, as you can clearly see; but really I'm nothing but a bag of bones. The afterlife's pretty nice; it's a bit repetitive, but I can get used to it. It's pretty chill! ...Well, aside from all the unmentionable horrors that are out to kill me *again*. Maybe if I keep running around, I can find a way outta this place? Or at least set some new high scores."

Bona Fido is a fast-paced, single-screen platformer, inspired by classic arcade games but with a spooOOooky twist. Try for a new high score again and again as you narrowly dodge enemies, dig up treasures that could either help you eke out a record or spell your utter demise, and bark your way to becoming top dog of the afterlife! Don't worry, it only goes on forever.

# Gameplay Basics

## Controls

The d-pad, A and B buttons, and crank are required to play this game. The face buttons are also used to navigate menus.

During gameplay:

## Gameplay

The d-pad runs around. A button jumps, B button barks. The crank helps you dig up opportune stuff in the ground. Run around and dodge the enemies; bark to kill 'em and move up to a harder (but higher-scoring) level. You've got three "lives" (hah) — run out, and it's game over.

Enemies, obviously, are bad. If you run into them, they'll kill ya (...again), as quick as can be. Luckily, your bark seems to shut 'em up and make 'em go away. Press B to use that, if you find yourself in a pinch.

Dig-ups are items that sprout from the ground occasionally. Some are good, some are bad, but you don't know what's what until you go fish it out. If you see something buried in the ground, use the crank to dig it up before it disappears. Trick or treat!
