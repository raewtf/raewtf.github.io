            <li>
                All of my friends, as well as everybody in the Playdate Squad Discord (especially the peeps in the RowBot Devlog) have been a tremendous source of feedback and testing and such from the start. This game, nor I, probably wouldn't even be around right now without all of you. Thank you specifically to the playtesters:
                <ul>
                    <li>NickSr, Orkn, and Toad!</li>
                </ul>
                ...and Randomshelf, who gave me the idea of the "<i>Row</i>man Emperor". It was too good not to include, frankly.
            </li>
            <li>TheMediocritist's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/1198071240980713502">awesome work</a> got me inspired to try polygonism for the main boat â€” they provided their code which was a great help in learning how a lot of it worked; and they, Neven, Jackson_57, and Voxy were big helps in getting it all super polished and performant!</li>
            <li>Superfunc helped me get pretty much the whole game running reeeeal nice and steady. Hooray, optimization!</li>
            <li><a href="https://tanukprod.itch.io">Schyzo</a> made a nice <a href="https://github.com/Schyzophrenic/Tanuk_CodeSequence">button code sequencing library</a>, which saved me a lot of time With Nothing In Particular. (wink)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>...and thank <i>you</i> â€” yes, you â€” for (hopefully) liking my silly little boat game! ðŸ’–</p>
